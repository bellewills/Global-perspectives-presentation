# SmartVote – Predictive Voting UI Mockup

This is a speculative, dystopian-style UI prototype for a fictional government-run voting platform called **SmartVote**. It was created for a short film project as part of the *Global Perspectives on Computer Science* unit.

The interface simulates:
- Identity verification
- Neural chip connection with loader
- Auto-filled voting based on predictive data
- A final confirmation message

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open `smartvote.html` in the editor.
3. Right-click `smartvote.html` and choose **"Open with Live/Five Server"**  
   (or past this link : http://127.0.0.1:5500/voting-auto/smartvote.html)


> No additional setup or packages required.

## Notes

- All animations and transitions are handled with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Designed to be screen-recorded as part of a speculative short film — not a functional app.
