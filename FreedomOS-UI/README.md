## FreedomOS – Encrypted Data Sovereignty Mockup

FreedomOS is a speculative, futuristic UI prototype that imagines a sovereign operating system where the user holds full control over layered personal data. It was developed as part of a short film and critical design artefact for the Global Perspectives on Computer Science unit.

## The interface simulates:

A warm welcome to the OS

A bold tagline reminding users of their autonomy

A layered data protection visual: from identity to medical records and voting preferences

## How to Run:

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Open freedomOS.html in the editor.

Right-click freedomOS.html and choose "Open with Live/Five Server"
(or paste this in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5500/freedomOS-UI/freedomOS.html)

No installations or packages needed — everything runs in the browser.

## Notes

Built entirely with HTML and CSS, using light JavaScript-free interactions.

Intended for speculative screen capture and narrative storytelling — not an actual OS.
